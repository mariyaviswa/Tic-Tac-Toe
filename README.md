# Description

<p style="text-align: justify;">This project is a Python-based Tic-Tac-Toe game featuring a graphical user interface built using Tkinter. It allows two players to play alternately on a 3x3 grid with real-time interaction. 
  The game enhances the user experience with color-coded symbols - blue for player X and red for player O - along with a click sound effect that plays each time a move is made. When a player wins, 
  the winning combination is highlighted in green, and the game automatically resets after a win or a draw. The use of sound through the playsound library and the smooth handling of events 
  with threading make the game responsive and engaging. 
  This project is ideal for beginners to learn about GUI development, event-driven programming, and basic game logic in Python.
